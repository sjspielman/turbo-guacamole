Currently, the notebook `analyses/explore_spotify_variation.Rmd` begins to explore variation in the spotify songs dataset using only a PCA.
We'd like to expand this analysis to also visualize a UMAP from this data, as well as identify and visualize variables in the dataset which may contribute to the variation seen in the UMAP.
One particular item to be aware of is that the notebook is currently deterministic with only PCA, but when adding UMAP we will be adding some stochasticity; therefore, a random seed will need to be set to ensure reproducibility.
