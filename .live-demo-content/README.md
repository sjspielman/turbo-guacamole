This directory has two sets of contents:

- The `issue-templates/` directory holds markdown files representing issues that need to be filed for use during live demos by (pending) GHA
- Notebook [`explore-spotify-variation-with-UMAPs.Rmd`](explore-spotify-variation-with-UMAPs.Rmd), which has expanded the [`explore-spotify-variation.Rmd`](../analyses/explore-spotify-variation.Rmd) notebook with UMAPs for use during the live demo of performing code review
